practice instructions at: https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-2-the-neophyte/chapters/JS_FUNCTION_BASICS.md

exercise was to create a function that iterates over an array of words to build a sentence. with each step the function grows steadily more complicated - adding punctuation every third word, adding parameters to decide the punctuation, adding parameters to decide how many times the punctuation is used. 

last instruction is to add arrow notation to the function.
